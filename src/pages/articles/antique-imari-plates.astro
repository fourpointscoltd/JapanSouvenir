                    Antique Imari porcelain, with its distinctive blue, red, and gold palette, has captivated collectors worldwide for centuries. But these treasures need not remain behind glass—they can bring extraordinary beauty to everyday dining.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-jp-black mt-12 mb-6">A Brief History of Imari</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Imari ware takes its name from the port of Imari in Saga Prefecture, from which it was shipped to eager European markets beginning in the 17th century. The porcelain itself was produced in nearby Arita, making "Arita-yaki" and "Imari" often interchangeable terms.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    The most sought-after pieces date from the Edo period (1603-1868), featuring intricate hand-painted designs of phoenixes, peonies, and geometric patterns. These "Ko-Imari" (old Imari) pieces command premium prices at auctions worldwide.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-jp-black mt-12 mb-6">Mixing Old and New</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    The key to successfully incorporating antique Imari into modern settings is contrast. The ornate patterns actually complement minimalist aesthetics beautifully:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Use a single Imari piece as a statement against plain white dishes</li>
                    <li>Pair with natural materials like wooden serving boards or linen napkins</li>
                    <li>Let the plate be the star—keep food presentation simple</li>
                    <li>Mix patterns boldly; traditional Japanese aesthetics embrace asymmetry</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-jp-black mt-12 mb-6">Finding Authentic Pieces</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    While museum-quality antiques can cost thousands, beautiful pieces for daily use can be found at reasonable prices. Look for:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Flea markets in Kyoto and Tokyo</strong> — Toji Temple market (21st monthly) and Oedo Antique Market are excellent</li>
                    <li><strong>Antique districts</strong> — Kotto-dori in Tokyo's Aoyama neighborhood</li>
                    <li><strong>Regional pottery towns</strong> — Arita and Imari hold annual pottery festivals</li>
                    <li><strong>Online auctions</strong> — Yahoo! Japan Auctions has extensive selections</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-jp-black mt-12 mb-6">What to Look For</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    When evaluating antique Imari:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Check for chips, cracks, or repairs (some wear adds character; major damage affects value)</li>
                    <li>Examine the foot ring—older pieces show wear patterns</li>
                    <li>Look for slight irregularities that indicate hand-painting</li>
                    <li>Rich, slightly uneven cobalt blue suggests age</li>
                    <li>Gold decoration that has worn slightly is typical of genuine antiques</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-jp-black mt-12 mb-6">Price Expectations</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Meiji-era (1868-1912) plates suitable for everyday use: ¥3,000-15,000<br>
                    Edo-period pieces in good condition: ¥20,000-100,000+<br>
                    Rare Ko-Imari masterpieces: ¥500,000 and above
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Don't overlook slightly damaged pieces—a small chip on an otherwise beautiful plate makes for an affordable treasure that you'll actually use and enjoy.
                </p>
