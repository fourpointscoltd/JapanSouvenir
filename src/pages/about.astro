                <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                    Born and raised in Japan, I've spent my life surrounded by the country's rich traditions of craftsmanship. Growing up, I watched my grandmother perform the tea ceremony each week, learned to fold kimono from my mother, and visited pottery studios with my father on weekend drives through the countryside.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    After years of living abroad and returning home, I began to see Japan with fresh eyes. What had once been familiar became fascinating—the dedication of artisans who spend decades mastering a single craft, the philosophy of finding beauty in imperfection, the way a simple object can carry centuries of cultural meaning.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Japan Souvenir was born from a desire to share these discoveries with travelers and lovers of Japanese culture around the world. This isn't about tourist trinkets or mass-produced goods with "Japan" stamped on them. It's about the real things—the chasen whisk made by the 20th generation of a Nara family, the indigo-dyed textile still created using methods unchanged for 400 years, the ceramic bowl that a master potter shaped while thinking of nothing but that single moment.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Each article on this site is the result of personal visits to workshops, conversations with artisans, and careful research into the history and techniques behind Japanese crafts. I write about:

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif text-jp-black mt-12 mb-6">My Philosophy</h3>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The best souvenir isn't just something you bought in Japan—it's something that brings Japan into your daily life. A teacup that makes your morning ritual more meaningful. A textile that adds warmth and history to your home. An object that connects you to the hands that made it and the traditions they carry forward.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    I believe in buying less but buying better. In supporting artisans who preserve irreplaceable knowledge. In the idea that the things we surround ourselves with shape how we live.
